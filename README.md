# Image-Encryptor
A basic python image encryptor.

Just run the encrypt_image.py file, when asked to give input then input the file-name of the image. The program will create a "encrypted_image.jpg" file. To decrypt the file just run the decypt_image.py file. 
Note: All the image files should be in the same directory as the code. Also dont change the file name of the encrypted and decrypted image.
